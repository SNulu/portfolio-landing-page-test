        <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>

        <p>My background is in Human Nutrition and Dietetic. I've worked in Community Nutrition
        for the past 10 years. <em>In my teens I attended coding camp in Seattle and Eugene, Oregon two
        summers in enroll, so when I thought of a career change I recalled my past explosure to programming</em>.
        Code Developer has change alot since the mid 90s. At camp we were taught a coding language called
        BASIC programming, which is no longer in use now days. One thing that has not change is that the indstry
        is still dominated by males, but it seems that females are starting to take more interest.</p>

        <p><strong>My current hobbies include</strong> baking, workingout with my dogs, reading and traveling with my husband.</p>
